# Knitty
WIP: iOS App for creating knitting patterns, counting rows and much more!

# Current version capabilities:
Current version supports working on one project: banana socks. This pattern is modified version of [banana socks.](https://www.kotona.com/articles/banana-socks) This pattern is modified in a way that socks follow anatomical assymmetric shape of feet.

**Row counting:** Each part of the project has it's own row counter. In the knitting window buttons to go the next row or to unravel a row are available.

# MVP Plan:
MVP Version will contain following features:
- Creating and editing knitting projects
- Row counters for each part of the project, including second row counter for repeating patterns in a project.
- Creating a project while knitting: add rows while knitting, describe what's been done on recently completed row, no need to pre-plan or download patterns, just unlock your creativity!
